    "description": "Hi. We’re Zipline. We’re helping put technology into the hands of those that need it most - - field workers. If you have worked in a store, you know the drill. You’re helping customers, ringing up orders and trying to do the 30 tasks that HQ wants you to do. Some pertain to you. Some don’t. But that’s for you to figure out… all while putting out fires and keeping shelves tidy. \n\nThat’s where we come in! We turn the grind of retail communications into an engaging, effective, aha solution. The Zipline platform ensures that the right people get the right information in the right way. Everyone is on the same page, tasks are tracked and life feels less like a perpetual game of hair-on-fire.\n\nWith Zipline, employees feel more connected, understand the role they play in the brand’s mission and can feel good about the work they’re doing. This is important to us because retail is one of America's most populous workforces but also one of the most underserved. Through Zipline, we can touch one in four American workers who are often minority, women and working part-time while studying or taking care of family. \n\nWe love helping retailer workers love their jobs because we know how much better life is when you love your work. This year, Retail Zipline became “Great Place to Work-Certified”. 97 percent of our employees say Zipline is a great place to work, compared to 59% of employees at a typical U.S.-based company. What’s even more impressive is that 100% of employees say, “I can be myself around here”, “I am treated as a full member here regardless of my position” and “People here are willing to give extra to get the job done.” 100 percent! You can’t beat the Zipline culture.\n\nToday, hundreds of thousands of people rely on Zipline to get their work done. Customers include Sephora, AEO Inc., Old Navy, LUSH Cosmetics and many more.",
